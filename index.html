      <h1 id="coding">Learning Coding</h1>
      <p>When I was smaller, my dad made an account in <a href = "https://code.org/">code.org</a> for me to learn basic coding, and after I learned the basics,
        I made an account in Scratch where I experimented and learned more about coding.<br>
        I had an account in Khan Academy where I used it to learn about math and science, but I discovered there were courses about
        Javascript, HTML and CSS, and now I can make simple webpages like this.

      <p>
      Yesterday, I woke up feeling very sick, I had a stomachache and I vomited as soon as I went into the washroom, these were all symptoms of food poisoning. <br>
        I felt dizzy and I went to the washroom more than 10 times in the day. After I took a nap, I immediately felt better and had more of an appetite.
