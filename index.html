        <p>
        This is an online blog about me. <br>
        I am a boy that likes badminton, playing the violin and reading books.<br>
        My favorite color is green and I like eating eggs and watermelons.

      <h1 id="coding">Learning Coding</h1>
      <p>When I was smaller, my dad made an account in code.org for me to learn basic coding, and after I learned the basics,
        I made an account in Scratch where I experimented and learned more about coding.<br>
        I had an account in Khan Academy where I used it to learn about math and science, but I discovered there were courses about
        Javascript, HTML and CSS, and now I can make simple webpages like this.
